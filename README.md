# Odyssey
Repo for solving Fly.io's Gossip Glomers distributed systems challenges.

## Purpose
I wanted to go about bettering skills in distributed systems and a set of good challenges arose from [fly.io](https://fly.io/dist-sys/).
I also wanted to better my Rust skills so my intention is to do these challenges in two parts - first with go and then 
with rust.

## Learnings

## Scratch Notes
- I believe that this is an iterative process and a system passing challenge 3 will still pass challenge 1. Therefore, I will
just create new branches and merge them into main as we go. However, if this does not hold, I will create and hold onto branches.
